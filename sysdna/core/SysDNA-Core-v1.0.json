SYSDNA CORE INVARIANTS
ID: SysDNA-Core-v1.0
Status: FROZEN

INV-1 Sequential Monotonicity  
State transitions must follow a strictly ordered DAG.

INV-2 Atomic Commit Boundaries  
Cross-domain effects must use atomic commit or saga patterns.

INV-3 Idempotency Keys  
All mutation requests require deterministic idempotency keys.

INV-4 Irreversibility Gating  
Irreversible effects are forbidden prior to commit acknowledgment.

INV-5 Bounded Fan-Out  
Triggers must enforce explicit upper bounds on downstream execution.

INV-6 Serialized State Access  
Shared state mutation requires CAS or equivalent serialization.

All invariants are necessary. Removal of any invariant reintroduces a structural failure.
