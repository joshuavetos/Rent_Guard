STRUCTURAL FAILURE DOMAIN DEFINITION
ID: SFDD-v1.0
Status: FROZEN

A failure is structural if and only if it results solely from system interaction, independent of business semantics.

F1: Ordering Violation  
An effect executes before its prerequisite is committed.

F2: Partial Commit  
One system commits while another fails, leaving global state inconsistent.

F3: Zombie Mutation  
A retried request executes multiple times, duplicating side effects.

F4: Premature Irreversibility  
An irreversible action occurs before transaction finalization.

F5: Resource Exhaustion via Fan-out  
A single trigger causes unbounded downstream execution.

F6: Race Condition  
Concurrent actors mutate shared state without serialization.

Explicitly out of scope:
- Logic errors
- Authorization errors
- Performance or availability collapse
