COMPLETENESS DECLARATION
ID: TESSRAX-DECLARATION-001
Date: December 20, 2025

SysDNA is declared COMPLETE with respect to SFDD-v1.0.

For any system expressible within the SysDNA composition model, no failure caused purely by structural interaction (F1–F6) can occur if invariants INV-1 through INV-6 hold.

This invariant set is minimal and closed.
